width=480 height=713 src="PoetryOfASoldier_files/image001.jpg"></a></p>

<p class=NoIndent>Everybody’s life is a story.  Each of those stories is
comprised of many chapters.  Some chapters, or even in some cases the whole
story, are easier to read than others.  Sometimes though, a single chapter out
of that person's life can be quite unique, or a real mystery.  Fredrick Hugh
Young was one of those people who had one of those unique chapters in his life;
one of those chapters that just didn’t seem to fit in with the rest of his
life.  It's not that having one of those chapters is bad, especially if we can
learn from them and become a better person as a result.  That certainly holds
true for Fred’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to wonder what makes a person who they are.  Why
am I like me and why are you like you?  Which of life’s experiences have
combined to make us who we are?  Is there a cumulative effect?  Does a single
experience help build and shape us for the next experience?  What can we do
with our experiences to change who we are, and to better ourselves in this
life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this book, we’ll examine what made Fred the man he was. 
What experiences helped form his life?  Why was he thoughtful and kind, always
so quick with a ready smile?  Why did he seem so content, so calm, so at
peace?  Why was he so well liked by so many?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To answer some of those questions, we have to first know a
little bit about Fred.  He was born in 1909.  As a young boy he experienced the
early cars being introduced to the world.  But, for many of those years, his
father continued using horses and wagons to haul building materials and
scaffolding.  His aunts and uncles had farms and raised animals.  His younger
brother Lloyd died of influenza during the Spanish Flu epidemic when Fred was
ten years old.  When he was eleven or twelve his family moved to California,
where he enjoyed the freedoms of a young teenager spending many long hours
playing with his friends.  He was a bit shy and was held back a year while in
high school because he couldn’t pass his public speaking class.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred began work in the building trades industry and at one
point became a salesman for a building supply company traveling throughout
Southern California. Most of his life he worked as a plasterer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Fred was forty-nine, with a family of five children, he
bought a house in a neighborhood of tract homes in the little Southern
California town of La Habra.  There was an empty lot between his house and the
main street in town.  Prime commercial property, it belonged to the man who
owned the Ford dealership.  Each summer the man who owned the lot would have
the weeds plowed under.  Numerous times while Fred lived in that house
something would come up regarding the land being sold and a business coming in
and building something right next to Fred's house.  At one time there was talk
of a liquor store, at another of a car wash.  Many of the neighbors were
opposed to whatever development was being proposed and they went to the city
council to voice their protest.  They often wanted Fred to go because he stood
to lose the most, and he would be impacted more than anyone else.  Fred never
went to the meetings.  Maybe it was because he had flunked his public speaking
class while in high school.  It may have been because, as he would tell the
neighbors, “It’s their property.  They can do with it what they want.  If they
are interested in knowing what I think about it, they can come talk to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The property was never sold or developed during his lifetime
- nor was it sold or developed during the six years following his death.  But
within a few short years of his wife Lillian’s death, it was sold and
developed, four tall condominiums blocking the beautiful view Fred and Lil had
enjoyed of the hills near their home for over forty years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What made Fred who, and what, he was?  And why was he like
that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred’s parents weren’t very good at handling money and his
father struggled keeping the business afloat.  During the thirties Fred
borrowed money to build a house for his parents and sisters to live in.  Fred
figured that if he were responsible for making the payments, at least he would
always have a roof over his head.  His parents lived there until after Fred
came home from the war and got married.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one of his letters to his sister during the war he wrote…</p>

<p class=PoemText align=right style='text-align:right'>Dec 3, 1944</p>

<p class=PoemText>Dear Doris,</p>

<p class=PoemText style='text-indent:.25in'>Your trip to the races sure sounded
like a lot of fun.  Did you dig into the grocery money like mom did?  Maybe
that’s why mom is sticking on her diet so well.  If she loses some of her
grocery money on some nag she cuts down on her food till she gets even again. 
Watch her gain weight when she has a good day and wins a pile. - I’ll send a
short letter soon so hang on awhile.</p>

<p class=PoemText align=right style='text-align:right'>Love Bud</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps this explains why Fred set financial goals throughout
his life.  They might not have been lofty goals compared to today’s standards,
but they seemed to be fiscally sound.  Fred saved money.  Fred bought some
bonds.  Fred bought some stocks.  Fred lived within his means.  He always paid
cash for all but his first car, a 1936 Chevy Coupe.  After paying off the loan
he vowed he would never buy a car on credit again, and he didn't. Fred had
enough money to take care of himself and his wife until their death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he was thirty-three, a major shift occurred in Fred's
life. He was drafted into the Army and stationed in Hawaii. For the first time
in his life, he began writing poetry. He never wrote poetry before his military
service or after. But during this intriguing period of his life, he expressed
himself in ways that were both meaningful and beautiful. It is this chapter of
Fred's life that we'll now explore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully, this chapter of his life will give us some
insights for our own lives.  Hopefully we can learn from his chapter and we can
forge ahead and write our own new chapters.  Hopefully, as a normal kind of guy
or gal in our own right, as individuals we can become better, kinder, and more
complete.</p>

<p class=CustomSubHead>Making the most out of a bad situation...</p>

<p class=NoIndent><a name="USS_Arizona"><img border=0 width=480 height=380
src="PoetryOfASoldier_files/image003.jpg"></a></p>

<p class=NoIndent>After World War II began, men between the ages of 18 and 45
were liable for military service.  Fred wasn’t married at the time, nor did he
work in a civil defense related industry, so he became a prime candidate for
the draft.  He wasn’t happy about being drafted and expressed those feelings in
his poem “Greetings from your President.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><img border=0 width=444 height=577
src="PoetryOfASoldier_files/image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>“Greetings” from your President</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>The letter that came in the mail,<br>
It seemed to say, &quot;Come on to jail&quot;.<br>
The words that seemed my soul to rent<br>
Were &quot;'Greetings' from your President&quot;.<br>
That note had come from my draft board,<br>
And it contained no welcome word.<br>
My life would be my own no more.<br>
I thought of that, and then I swore.<br>
But off to war I sadly went<br>
After the little I'd saved was spent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>First I went to a camp for training.<br>
Things were bad, but I'm not complaining.<br>
Still, it's a fact the system was bad,<br>
Or maybe the fault was the non-coms we had.<br>
Yes, non-coms back there who hadn't seen action<br>
Were trying to teach us the proper reaction.<br>
The teachers we had were as dumb as could be.<br>
Here we've learned more, but we're now oversea.<br>
Out on the front one little mistake<br>
Can bring on the end without a retake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>The things we learn should be just right<br>
If men must save their lives to fight,<br>
And what non-com at home can tell<br>
Exactly how to keep from Hell.<br>
The best way is to watch the foe<br>
And learn from fighting toe to toe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>Fred Young</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During his first few months in the service Fred kept a
journal of sorts.  He wrote on small scrapes of paper, in very, very small
writing, some of his thoughts about the army.  He didn’t want anyone to see
them for fear of what might happen to him, so he kept them hidden.  He kept
them throughout his entire military service, and even up until near his death. 
Here are a few of the things he wrote.</p>

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>“Induction. - The hell begins. -  Fellows quite drunk when
arriving at Ft. McArthur.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText> “Clothing - nothing fits. -  Physical inspections - Mech
aptitude tests line up for everything - First taste of no privacy, no friends,
just a bunch of fellows all wondering what next? - Non coms yelling.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText> “Some non coms have pretty bad records in civilian life.”</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we react when things aren't going exactly as we want
them to go?  Do we gripe and complain?  Do we call foul?  Or do we quietly move
forward, doing the best we can with the situation at hand?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jenkin Lloyd Jones once said, “Anyone who imagines that
bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he
has been robbed. The fact is that most putts don’t drop, most beef is tough,
most children grow up to be just like people, most successful marriages require
a high degree of mutual toleration, and most jobs are more often dull than
otherwise. Life is just like an old time rail journey...delays, sidetracks,
smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful
vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for
letting you have the ride.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred was in the Army.  It wasn't what he wanted, and there
would be some discouraging days ahead, but during this time he found a way to
cope.  That coping mechanism included poetry. He came out of that chapter of
his life a better man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What can we learn from Fred, and how can we come out of the
chapters of our life better people?  Can we make the most out of any and all
bad situations that may come along? Can we forego the complaining and
bellyaching?  Can we stop crying “foul”?  We will see that if we do we can
begin to make the changes in our lives that will help us have a better life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><a name="Nan_And_Fred"><img
border=0 width=480 height=713 src="PoetryOfASoldier_files/image005.jpg"></a></p>

<p class=NoIndent>Even though Fred ended up a Staff Gunnery Sergeant it’s
obvious from some of his writings and poems that he had other opportunities to
learn new skills along the way.  He learned how to be a shoeshine boy, a moving
man, a bug exterminator, and a cook.</p>

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>“At Callan I learned how to shine shoes how to hate army
life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText> “We are grouped as big gun crews, mach gun crews,
communications etc. - I move 5 times first week.  mosquitoes are hell
especially when on guard duty K.P best job I have had.”</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I imagine it was during one of his turns on guard duty that
he composed the poem “The Sentry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><img border=0 width=480 height=288

<p class=PoemText align=center style='text-align:center'>The Sentry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>'Neath the light of the moon, as I stand at this post,<br>
I just think of my home and the folks I love most,<br>
Then my thoughts swing to war and the world with its hate,<br>
For I've heard a noise and I hope not too late.<br>
Not too late, I find out, for the noise I heard<br>
Was no Jap, was not mortal, not even a bird,<br>
But the noise of mosquitoes that dive in the night<br>
Droning in to deliver a hell of a bite.<br>
One bite isn't bad for it's over right soon,<br>
But it hurts when there's millions beneath that bright moon.<br>
So I stand there and cuss and I rave and I rant,<br>
And wish to go home but they say that I can't,<br>
So I dream of that day when I'll sail far away<br>
To that land I love best, that good U.S.A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText align=right style='text-align:right'>Fred Young</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We all end up at one time or another with jobs we may not
like, and Fred was no exception. As a plasterer Fred found himself working
precariously high on scaffolding perched above the rocky California coastal
cliffs.  He worked in cold and rainy weather.  He drove well over an hour each
way to and from work, sometimes through fog so thick he could cut it with a
knife. But the only time he quit a job was when his boss was less than honest
with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred was also a family man, as the poem indicates at the
beginning (“I just think of my home and the folks I love most”) and again
somewhat at the end (“And wish to go home”).  Fred stayed very close and
connected to his immediate family as well as his extended family throughout his
entire life.  He made long trips across the country to visit aunts, uncles and
cousins.  It wasn’t unusual for his Saturdays to include a drive out to see
family.  I doubt that a week ever went by when he didn’t call at least one of
his sisters or his mother.  He expressed concern over his phone bill, but that
was an expense he wasn’t ready to do away with.  Family, and the connection
with them, was very important to Fred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we stay close to our families?  Do we work out any issues
we may have and build strong and lasting relationships?  We should.  There's no
place like home.</p>

<p class=NoIndent>When Fred became a Boy Scout Assistant Scoutmaster in the
early 1960s, he told the troop leadership that if he was going to serve he
wanted to only be an assistant scoutmaster who taught the new scouts the basic
scouting skills. He had been a Boy Scout as a young boy in California.  The
troop would sometimes take the street car to the end of the line and then hike
to their camping spot.  He enjoyed camping.  As a Boy Scout he never advanced
past the rank of Tenderfoot. Maybe as a result he felt he could only teach the
new scouts.  His request to teach no more than what he knew may have had its
roots with his experiences in the army.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred didn’t think very highly of the training he received
before going to the Pacific Islands during the war. Once there, his training
continued and in time he submitted this poem for publication.</p>

<p class=PoemText align=center style='text-align:center'>A G I Trains for the
Jungle</p>

<p class=PoemText align=center style='text-align:center'>A Poem</p>

<p class=PoemText align=center style='text-align:center'>By Sgt. Fred Young</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>We went to the jungle for training<br>
  Because of the order we got;<br>
While there it rained and got muddy,<br>
  'Twas seldom we found it too hot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>We learned about crossing a river<br>
  By using a tent for a float;<br>
We found we could get a gun over<br>
  Without any aid of a boat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>They taught us to kill with a stick or knife<br>
  By jabbing a man through the gut,<br>
How to cripple or maim or to crush<br>
  With the blow of a mere rifle butt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>There are times you can live in a jungle<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>Yes, those are some of the things we learned,<br>
  And I hope we learned them well,<br>
For there may be a time at a later date<br>
  When they'll keep us away from Hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred was a very good scout leader - he always seemed
prepared. He could start a fire with flint and steel, a bow and a stick, or
with the batteries from his flashlight. He never complained on long hikes and
he was always happy to sleep out under the stars.  He was patient and kind to
the new scouts, and always willing to do his part to help. Fred learned the Boy
Scout Oath, Slogan, Motto and Law, and he lived by them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred determined that his teaching and training skills would
be much different than what he had experienced while in the Army.  He
determined to never be like them, but rather to be better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How calm and collected are you when you are trying to teach
someone a new skill?  How willing are you to slow down and make sure they learn
upon a firm foundation?  Are you willing to teach a man how to fish, rather
than just doing it for him because it is easier, thus insuring that man a
lifetime of fish for himself and his family?  We have so many opportunities to
teach others, whether it is our own children or coworkers.  However it might
be, let’s teach them to fish.</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outwardly Fred wasn't a religious man.  While he sometimes
went to church as a young boy, it was mostly a social event.  After he moved
with his family to California he only attended church when visiting his
cousins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Fred's son became interested in religion and wanted to
join a church Fred said, “I know a lot of good Catholics, a lot of good
Lutherans, a lot of good Presbyterians, and a lot of good Mormons.  I know a
lot of bad ones of each of them as well, whatever you decide to do, be a good
one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred decided to not be of any religion, but somewhere along
the way he decided to be good.  That decision may have solidified while in the
Army.  He was always kind, and tried to never speak ill of others.  That’s not
to say he never called anyone a crook or a crumb, but if he said it they were
probably more than deserving of the title, and he never said it with malice or
hatred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Was Fred’s religious belief formed as a little boy?  Did it
develop during his summer visits with his cousins?  Or, was there something
about his stint in the Army that formulated his thinking that led him through
the rest of his life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following two poems, neither titled, reveal a part of
Fred that may have helped form the base of his beliefs.  They reveal deep
introspection on his part. </p>

<p class=PoemText>The sound that I heard was a plane overhead.<br>
The motors, they sputtered, and then they were dead.<br>
The plane came to earth in a long gliding dive,<br>
And the men who were in it are no more alive.<br>
As the plane hit the earth with a sickening crash,<br>
There was smoke and then fire, then nothing but ash.<br>
Those men, they died there, in that bright flaming pyre,<br>
And are now with their Maker, home to retire.</p>

<p class=PoemText>This Sunday I went to church near our camp.<br>
I went to the front and I climbed up the ramp.<br>
I found me a seat way up close to the stand<br>
So I'd be near the Chaplin and also his band.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>The Chaplin I like, for he talks mighty well,<br>
And he has many tales which he likes to tell.<br>
He told of a road which was narrow and thin,<br>
And was harder to follow than the path of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>He said that sin's way is so easy to find<br>
Because it's unfixed like a roving mind.<br>
Its branches are many, so some follow it<br>
To discover at last they've improved not a bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>But the path of the righteous so narrow and thin,<br>
Some follow and fight till they're nearly done in,<br>
But the end of it leads to the Holy Grail,<br>
So they can be proud if they stick to that trail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>In the end, I'm sure that the trail which is right<br>
Is the trail which is thin. Yes, the trail that's a fight.<br>
And that is the trail I'm convinced is the best<br>
Because it's the trail which leads over the crest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>I went back to camp and I sat down to think,<br>
“Does the trail I am on lead over the brink?”<br>
And I made up my mind to get onto a trail<br>
Which I feel on the end will lead to the Grail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred never joined a church during his lifetime, but he was a
better man than most of us will ever be.  He always treated people kindly, and
he tried not to be judgmental.  What was his thought process?  How can we make
up our minds to choose goodness, and rightness?  In my mind Fred is truly one
of the noble and great ones of the earth.  Can we also be noble and great, too?</p>

<p class=ChapterHeading><a name="Chapter_6_Friend_Or_Foe">Chapter 6 – Friend or

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><img border=0 width=480 height=604
src="PoetryOfASoldier_files/image012.jpg"></p>

<p class=NoIndent>Throughout Fred’s life he tried to not be a respecter of
person.  He treated each person based on who they were, not what they were.  It
didn’t matter whether you were a successful businessman or a struggling
plumber, Fred treated you well.  But, if the plumber was honest and the
businessman was a crumb, Fred’s respect for the plumber was an hundred times
greater. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred struggled with how the army was organized based on rank
and not on what kind of person someone was. It bothered him.  One of his
relatives, a cousin, was an officer stationed in Hawaii.  Fred visited him on a
few occasions, but felt like his cousin brushed him off because Fred wasn’t an
officer and didn’t want be seen with Fred.  I imagine it was experiences like
that, and other ones while in the Army, that prompted him to write about
“Jimmy.”</p>

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>Jimmy and I were friends for a while<br>
Till I got my stripe then he lost his smile.<br>
As bucks we’d been the best of pals<br>
Joshing and kidding about our gals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>Then I got a stripe and Jim wouldn’t talk<br>
He’d just grunt and groan and me he’s balk.<br>
I’d want him to come and visit a friend<br>
But me he’d refuse and my heart he’d rend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>The reason for that was he had no stripe<br>
So all he would do was sit and gripe.<br>
His head was hung with grief and woe<br>
And I seemed to be his deadly foe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>We’d talk of a trip to town we two<br>
But now he says No! I’ll not go with you.<br>
Your stripe makes you up one notch from me<br>
So now I’ll not go anywhere with thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>He goes to the store and leaves me behind<br>
The fact that I’m lonesome he doesn’t mind.<br>
Because now his mind is so full of hate<br>
He no longer considers me as his mate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>I hope that some day he’ll be friendly some more<br>
So I shall be welcome to come to his door.<br>
I hope he’ll get stripes all over his sleeves<br>
And completely get over the most of his peeves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are we when it comes to our treatment of others?  Do we
think we are “better” than they are?  Or maybe do we think we are “not good

<p class=MsoNormal>We are all children of our Father in Heaven, regardless of
the color of our skin, or the years of education we have, or a host of other

them with respect.</p>

<p class=NoIndent>Fred never really got down in the dumps.  Nothing seemed to
faze him.  He was a very steady man.  He must have had his down days, but he
never seemed to show it.</p>

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>After a few fairly pleasant days at Weaver all is changed
again - New gun commanders - learn things anew from guys who have to hold the
book in one hand and read the answers while they point out part with other hand
- Can men learn how and have confidence under such methods of instruction.  The
New York guys are over us now the guys wid de brogue.  There are several
corporal &amp; P.F.C. positions open but hell, I believe I'd sooner be a happy
Buck Private maybe this is just my day for feeling blue-er.  Fired our first
shots with 3&quot; guns.  I was relayer.  Like this camp fine.  Find that these

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>Still think of the little blonde but haven't heard from her
for so long that I don't believe she thinks of me.  Sometimes think, hell, I've

<p class=MsoNormal>All of us can have some down days every once in a while. 
Things can happen differently than we would expect or hope them to.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the next untitled poem, Fred expresses his low as well as
the high.  He also expresses that which matters most to him, his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><img border=0 width=480 height=260

<p class=SepTop>----------</p>

<p class=PoemText>Your letter arrived when my spirits were low.<br>
The next thing I knew they were high and aglow.<br>
Yes, my spirits had changed from way below par<br>
To the way they are now. Right up close to a star.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>The news of your note was cheerful and gay<br>
And reminded of things that we'd done in our day.<br>
It told of some night spots we'd done in the past<br>
The memories of which I shall keep till the last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText>Still what I like best, is not what you relate<br>
But the fact that you write and I still seem to rate.<br>
It's pleasant to feel that there's someone back there,<br>
With my welfare at heart and who still seems to care.</p>

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred had three sisters: Margaret, Doris, and Catherine.  He
didn't like one any better than another and he was always very kind to all
three.  He would phone them all regularly, and whenever he made a trip into
town to visit one of them he would always visit the other ones as well.  There
seemed to be tremendous love in Fred’s family. Even after Fred died, six years
later when his wife Lillian was just days away from her own death, Fred’s two
remaining sisters, both in their eighties, came to be with Lil.  They really
did care. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we respond to our challenges, to our moments of
feeling down?  Do we let them drag us further downward? Or, do we look on the
bright side?  Do we pick ourselves back up?  Do we bound, bound, bound and
rebound?</p>

<p class=PoemText>Dear Doris,</p>

<p class=PoemText style='margin-left:.25in'>I get out my paper and pick up my

I just start to write, and what happens then<br>
I examine my pen Yes, I’m all out of ink<br>
So I put back my paper and sit down to think<br>
Well the letter I planned it wouldn’t be much good,<br>
And the news which I had could be misunderstood<br>
So I guess I had better just rest up or play<br>
And I’ll sit down and write on some other day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText style='text-indent:.25in'>Some procrastination eh what?  I
just haven’t felt like writing lately and nearly always put off writing until
tomorrow.  I expect to get around to writing both mom and you soon but thought
I’d send this note to let you know I’m feeling fit as a fiddle and haven’t
forgotten you folks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=PoemText style='text-indent:.25in'>Thanx for the cookies.  They

<p class=SepBottom>----------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although Fred says he's “feeling fit as a fiddle and haven't
forgotten the folks back home,” the most telling line in his letter is the one
that says, “I just haven’t felt like writing lately…” Fred was lonely and
feeling a little down, and he missed his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we care?  Do we call?  Are we concerned?  It really
doesn't take much effort on our part, as long as we are sincere, to make a real
difference in the life of another person.  But, we do have to do something.  It
could be something as simple as a note, a phone call, or an email.  Some small
act of kindness can go a long way in helping to make another person's day
better, to help them rebound, to help them feel “right up close to a star.”</p>

But you who had nursed me through sickness &amp; care<br>
Would merely carress me and rumple my hair<br>
Then I recall when I first went to school<br>
It was you at my side who was keeping me cool<br>
And later when lessons got tough and I’d miss<br>
You’d say, better next time and give me a kiss.<br>
After many hard years when I finally got through<br>

And always you’ve struggled to help me along<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our mothers may not be perfect, but we are the ones who came

mother around the house, or sometimes just to visit with her.  He built
hand-railing and sturdy steps so she could safely come and go as she needed. 
He repaired her fence.  Fred welcomed her in to his own home to visit and
sometimes stay for a week at a time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We each need to re-examine our relationship with our

Now the outfit you’re wearing from bottom to top<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are we kind, considerate, and loving to our brothers and

with love?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can express our love and admiration through our words and
actions.  A phone call, a quick note or email, or a visit to their home can
speak volumes.  They are family.  Let’s enjoy the time we have together while

<p class=ChapterHeading><a name="Chapter_10_In_Summary">Chapter 10 – In Summary</a></p>

<p class=CustomSubHead>So very much to learn, and to do…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'><a name="Fred_With_Family"><img

<p class=NoIndent>Love…family…concern.  Fairness…respect…gratitude.  The list
could go on.  Fred Young was a good man, a very good man.  Fred left the Army a
better man than when he entered.  And though he didn’t like that he was in the
Army, he did his best while he was there, staying true to his beliefs,
developing an even larger and stronger belief system, and receiving an
honorable discharge at the end of the war as a staff gunnery sergeant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His attitude and the way he dealt with each situation was a
choice on his part to <i>do</i> what was good and right, and to <i>be</i> what
was good and right.  Each one of us is faced with situations every day in which
we have to make choices, the same types of choices Fred had to make.  If we
choose to <i>do good</i> and to <i>be good</i> each and every day, we too will
be remembered by our families and children and neighbors and friends just as
people fondly and lovingly remember Fred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fred’s time in the Army and the poems he wrote are a chapter
in his life that we really don’t know a lot about.  He never did talk much
about it.  They were and still remain a mystery.  But by reading his poems and
trying to imagine what he was thinking and feeling we can construct a clearer
picture of who Fred really was.  It’s a picture of a man who was filled with
goodness and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we love our mothers as deeply as he loved his?  Are we
teaching our children to have a deep and abiding love for their mothers?  Do we
love our brothers and sisters like he loved his?  Is there more that we can
do?  Can we call them more often?  Can we write them and tell them that we love
them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about our belief in God?  Is it firm?  Is it true? 
Have we chosen our path?  Is it the thin and narrow one?  Is it the one that
will lead to the Holy Grail?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we treat others?  Are we a respecter of person,
giving preference to the rich and the powerful, or do we respect people for who
they are and treat them accordingly?  Do we show the same love and concern for
the rich neighbor as we do for the poor neighbor?  Do we respect our co-workers
like we respect our boss?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And following the principles Fred learned as a Boy Scout,
and which he taught as a scout leader, and which he lived every day, are we
trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful,
thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent?  If not, we should be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should each be asking ourselves these questions.  Are we
happy with our answers?  What can we do to change?  Is it time to start a new
chapter in our own lives?  Will the changes we make in our lives appear as
mysterious to people sixty years from now as Fred’s poetry appears to us? 
Unless we try, unless we make an effort to be better, and to be good and to be
kind, we will never know, and the chapters in our lives may never be worth
reading - not now, not later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are we going to do about it?  How are we going to
change?  To paraphrase a great religious leader, Spencer W. Kimball once said,
“So much depends upon our willingness to make up our minds, collectively and
individually, that our present levels of performance are not acceptable, either
to ourselves or to the Lord. In saying that, I am not calling for flashy,
temporary differences in our performance levels, but rather a quiet resolve to
do a better job, to lengthen our stride.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What kind of resolve will we make?  Will it be a quiet but
firm one?  Will it stretch us and make us better?  Will it be lasting?  Will it
be the one “which in the end will lead to the Grail?” </p>

<p class=CustomSubHead>The war chapters…</p>

<p class=NoIndent>Every person who fights for his or her country in war has a
different experience than the next.  The wars that are being fought now are
producing different experiences for those involved than the experiences had by
those who fought ten, twenty, forty, or even sixty years ago.  The experiences
are still defining.  They are each individual's own chapter.  They are
important chapters, and as such, it is important that as those chapters are being
written the author of those chapters make good choices so the final outcome of
the story of their life will be one they can be proud of, and one that will be
a blessing in the lives of their family, and to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have three short stories I want to relate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Story number one. While still in high school I visited a
friend’s home and heard his older brother tell us about his first few days in
Vietnam.  My friend’s brother was big and strong and had been the captain of
the high school football team just a few short months earlier.  Now he was home
on leave and telling us of the sheer terror he felt as he waded through rice
paddies looking for the enemy.  He told us of his first day on patrol and of
how, as he and his buddy came through the tall grass at the edge of a rice
paddy, his buddy was immediately gunned down.  My friend’s brother recalled how
he dropped to his knees and began firing his machine gun.  He expressed the
horror of how he couldn’t let up on the trigger and of how quickly his feelings
changed to survival, and worst of all, how he just wanted to kill every person
who might be an enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How has that chapter in his life changed him?  Did it help,
or hurt him?  What would something like that do to you?  What can we do with
tragedy so we become better rather than bitter?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Story number two.  The year before I became eligible for the
draft I had a friend who enlisted in the Army and went to Vietnam.  He wrote to
me a few times.  His letters spoke mostly of how drugs helped him escape from
the horrors of the war.  I never heard from him again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His story ended.  We never know when our life's story will
end.  It could end tomorrow due to health issues or an accident, or it could
end just due to old age.  Are we striving every day to write chapters of our
own life's story in such a way we will be proud to have others read them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Story number three.  The last story I include is about a man
I knew named Mark Wood.  The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor just weeks before
Mark turned eighteen.  He knew then, that as soon as he could, he was going to
enlist in the Army Air Corps, which he did immediately following his graduation
from high school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For about a year he was transferred around the United States
learning how to fly different models of airplanes.  He first learned to fly a
small bi-wing plane followed by faster single-engine planes.  Eventually he
flew the big four-engine B-24 bomber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after his training was complete he went to England
and within a month was flying bombing missions over Europe.  On his third
mission, while on his way back over Holland, his squadron was hit by
anti-aircraft fire.  In the course of the attack, his plane was hit and badly
damaged.  With the two inboard engines knocked out, his plane began falling
from the sky.  With his plane dropping from 22,000 feet while over the North
Sea on his flight back to England he offered a mighty prayer and made a pact
with his Heavenly Father.  He told God that if He would preserve his life
during the war then he, Mark, would serve Him faithfully throughout the rest of
his life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At about 6,000 feet Mark was finally able to make the
necessary adjustments (running the oil pressure higher than safe and keeping
the engine rpm above the maximum allowed for the engine) to level out the plane
and make it safely back to the air base in England.  The airplane was so
damaged it never flew again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark tells of other times when shrapnel exploded down
through the top of his cockpit, right in front of his face, bounced off the
floorboard, and ricocheted underneath his seat.  Had he been one-thousandth of
a second faster he might not have been alive to tell about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark recounts of being one of eleven planes going out on a
bombing mission and being the only plane to return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark also recalls of hearing the news that the war was
over.  He said upon news of the announcement he immediately went outside to the
top of one of the bomb shelters on base and made knee prints in the soft, damp
soil as he knelt in prayer and expressed his true gratitude to his Father in
Heaven for preserving his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On one occasion, after listening to Mark share some of his
stories about his time in the army, someone asked him which of all the planes
he had flown was his favorite.  Was it the little maneuverable bi-wing or the
fast single engine plane?  Mark paused for a minute and then, with his voice
cracking softly, said, “Well, I believe I’d have to say it was the B-24 that
brought me back across the North Sea on only two engines.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You see, the B-24 wasn’t designed to fly on only its two
outboard engines.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mark wrote a chapter of his life as he served in the Army
Air Corps, and he faithfully and valiantly served his Father in Heaven to the
end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all of us can have chapters of our lives written while
serving in the military during war, but each of us can be writing chapters in
our life's story.  I've written chapters as I left home and worked on a farm
for room and board.  I've written chapters as I left a job as a construction
foreman because the general contractor asked me to lie to building inspectors. 
I've written chapters as I have made decisions of family over fortune.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't know what my life story will be when it is complete
because I am still writing chapters.  Each of us is still writing our own
chapters.  It doesn't matter which cards we are dealt, or what life may throw
at us, it’s still our own responsibility to make good choices and decisions. 
It is still our responsibility to choose goodness over evil, to choose kindness
over meanness, to choose self<u>less</u>ness over self<u>ish</u>ness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully we are all writing good chapters for our own
life's stories.  Let’s write the best book we can.</p>
